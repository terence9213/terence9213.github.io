                    <p>Eternity Quest started out as an experiment, my first step into the world of game development. Having close to zero experience in game development, I harnessed what little programming knowledge I had gathered during the 4 years I spent in university and cooked up this monster.</p>
                    <p>With the limited experience I had in web development, I decided that Javascript would allow me to build a decent game, that would not only be a challenging endeavour, but also legitimately fun to play.</p>
                    <p>With the help of some free online resources, namely a couple of sprites from <a href="https://jonathan-so.itch.io/creatorpack">here</a> and a couple of icons from <a href="https://icons8.com/">here</a>, I am proud to say that I built Eternity Quest from the ground up with my bare hands.</p>
                    <p>You can find all the source code at my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/terence9213/terence9213.github.io">here</a>, for those who are interested. You may also notice that Eternity Quest does not rely on any external code library, or game engine. This is NOT because I'm stupid, but because I'm a minimalist.</p>
                    <p>For those of you wondering why I choose such a cheesy name for this game, trust me, I cringe at the sound of the name too. There was a silly vertical scrolling shooter game on Facebook that my friends and I got hooked on for a couple of weeks. It was called EverWing. So that's why this game is called Eternity Quest. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=inside+joke">#insidejoke</a></p>
                    <p>Shout out to my friends for their emotional support and for testing the earliest versions of this game, when it was glitchier than Assassin's Creed Unity or Mass Effect Andromeda.</p>
