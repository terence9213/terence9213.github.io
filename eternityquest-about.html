                    <p>Eternity Quest started out as an experiment, my first step into the world of game development. Having close to zero experience in game development, I harnessed what little programming knowledge I had gathered during the 4 years I spent in university and cooked up this monster.</p>
                    <p>With the limited experience I had in web development, I decided that Javascript would allow me to build a decent game, that would not only be a challenging endeavour, but also legitimately fun to play.</p>
                    <p>With the help of some free online resources, namely a couple of sprites from <a href="https://jonathan-so.itch.io/creatorpack">here</a> and a couple of icons from <a href="https://icons8.com/">here</a>, I am proud to say that I built Eternity Quest from the ground up with my bare hands.</p>
                    <p>You can find all the source code at my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/terence9213/terence9213.github.io">here</a>, for those who are interested. You may also notice that Eternity Quest does not rely on any external code library, or game engine. This is NOT because I'm stupid, but because I'm a minimalist.</p>
                    <p>For those of you wondering why I choose such a cheesy name for this game, trust me, I cringe at the sound of the name too. There was a silly vertical scrolling shooter game on Facebook that my friends and I got hooked on for a couple of weeks. It was called EverWing. So that's why this game is called Eternity Quest. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=inside+joke">#insidejoke</a></p>
                    <p>Shout out to my friends for their emotional support and for testing the earliest versions of this game, when it was glitchier than Assassin's Creed Unity or Mass Effect Andromeda.</p>

                <div class="container container-alt0">
                    <p>Eternity Quest is a straight forward top-down shooter.</p>
                    <p>Controls can be found in the settings menu, where you can toggle between mouse and keyboard control. You may also toggle sound effects and music in the settings menu.</p>
                    <p>In the inventory menu, you may purchase and upgrade your primary and secondary weapons. The first weapon, the "Blaster" can be purchased for free. You may equip 2 primary weapons and 1 secondary weapon to your loadout.</p>
                    <p>When you start the game, you will encounter waves of enemies and a boss enemy at every 3rd level. Enemy health, speed and spawning interval will increase gradually as you progress. A collision with an enemy, a boss, or the projectiles fired by the boss will result in instant death.</p>
                    <p>Most weapons have an overheat and cooldown timer. When a weapon overheats, it will become disabled until it has fully cooled down.</p>
                    <p>You can move the ship with either the mouse of the directional keys. (Mouse control is highly recommended)</p>
